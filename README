This is a book I am writing, called Learn You The Ruby. LYTR is a learning book 
for those who wish to learn how to use the Ruby programming language. The book 
is similar in design to Learn You A Haskell and Learn You Some Erlang. The book 
is similar in structure to Learn Python The Hard Way. It is a combination of 
those styles that makes Learn You An Ruby a unique experience.

The book takes the user from zero to developer by having them complete tasks 
that over time take what the user has learned and adds new layers. Finally the
user will be developing real applications with interesting uses. The book also
gives the user a little experience in the most popular gems, so the learner is 
well rounded for the developing life.
