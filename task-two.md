# Task Two - The Wealthiest Merchant And His Daughter

## Summary

In this task we'll learn about the other output display method, method arguments, and commenting. You'll learn about where and how to comment, why you want to comment, and the very basics of what an argument is! More importantly you'll find out about method syntax!

## Source

<script src=""></script>
    # This line is a comment. A comment is used to
    # document source code. This makes it easier to
    # read for others, and yourself.

    puts "The Wealthiest Merchant And His Daughter"
    puts "========================================"

    # Any part of a line after the pound sign is a comment, and not interpreted.

    puts "The boy and his lucky dog traveled along the wasteland together." # Like this.
    puts "They saw many things, but mostly trash and death." # These are comments
    puts "The adventerous two wandered through abandoned cities and towns."

    # puts "Avoiding raiders and wastelanders." # This is line is a comment.

    print "One time the two happened on a small town named ", '"Wall Mart Town"'
    print "\n"

    ### You can put multiple pound signs, but it doesn't read anything after the
    ## first pound sign. ##
        # You can even indent the comments!

    print '"Hey Lucky," ', "the boy says, ", '"Lets check this place out!"', "\n"
    puts("The dog didn't think this was a good idea.")
    print("But he's a dog", " what does he know!")
    puts("")

## Result

    $ ruby lyar2.rb
