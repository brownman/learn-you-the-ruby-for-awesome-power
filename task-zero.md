## Task Zero
## \_why: I Need Ruby, Lots Of Ruby

### Summary
This is the first lesson and it's probably the most important one you'll ever go through. Sadly it can also be the most difficult lesson. On the other hand you should only have to do this once every year or so. We're going to install Ruby and Gedit.

### Source
If you're using an OS different from these three we assume you know what you're doing. If you have problems, look in the Details section.

#### Major Operating Systems
[Linux (Ubuntu - Fedora)](/install-linux)
[Windows (XP - Vista - 7)](/install-windows) **INCOMPLETE**
[Mac (10.5)](install-mac) **INCOMPLETE**

#### Minor Operating Systems
[BSD (FreeBSD - OpenBSD)](/install-bsd) **INCOMPLETE**
[Unix (OpenSolaris - Solaris)](/install-unix) **INCOMPLETE**


### Result
There is no specific result. You should have working copies of both Ruby and Gedit now installed on your computer. See the Details and Extra Credit section for more information.


### Details
Ok, as I wrote above we're assuming you know how to use your operating system. If you don't you're going to have a little difficulty. I suggest you do some research, fire up Google and look around. It would literally take me an entire book to just talk about the various Operating Systems.

If you have a problem simply copy the error, open up your browser to here: [http://gist.github.com](http://gist.github.com) paste the error to that log field, and paste the resulting new link in a new issue here (You'll need a Github account): [http://github.com/krainboltgreene/learn-you-an-ruby-for-awesome-power/issues](http://github.com/krainboltgreene/learn-you-an-ruby-for-awesome-power/issues)


## Extra Credit
1. Open a few text files with gedit, get to know the interface and shortcuts.
2. Customize Gedit, Terminal, and your OS to better suit programming.
3. Go to the Learn You An Ruby website and download all the tasks and read through the glossary
4. Type this into a terminal: `gem install facets rspec linguistics sqlite3-ruby nokogiri rake pony sequel sinatra rails padrino nanoc eventmachine thin rack rack-test haml rdiscount --no-ri --no-rdoc`
