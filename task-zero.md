# Task Zero - `_why`: I Need Ruby, Lots Of Ruby

## Summary

This is the first lesson and it's probably the most important one you'll ever go through. Sadly it can also be the most difficult lesson. On the other hand you should only have to do this once every year or so. We're going to install Ruby and Gedit.

## Source

### Linux (Ubuntu)

    INSTALL CODE HERE

### Windows (XP)

    INSTALL CODE HERE

### Mac (OS 10.5)

    INSTALL CODE HERE

## Result

There is no specific result. You should have working copies of both Ruby and Gedit now installed on your computer. See the Details and Extra Credit section for more information.

## Details

Ok, we're assuming you know how to use your operating system. If you don't you're going to have a little difficulty. I suggest you do some research, fire up Google and look around. It would literally take me an entire book to just talk about the various Operating Systems.
