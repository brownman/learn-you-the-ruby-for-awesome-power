## How This Book Works

**Good!** You've heroically made it to chapter two. I promise this chapter won't be too terribly long. In fact it'll only be 5 seconds. In fact chapters three through ten will all be five sections long, while chapter two will have 2 setup sections and 5 learning sections. Each section of each chapter will be in five important sections:

* A brief summary of what the section will teach you
* A bit of source code
* A result of running the code
* A detailed description of each (new) important part
* And some extra credit tasks

Now that we know all the pieces to the puzzle it's time to learn how to read and use this book. Follow each step exactly and then go wild:

1. Read the brief description, don't worry if you don't fully understand it
2. Create a new file, in your projects directly (We'll get to that), called `lyar#.rb` and replace the # with the task number.
3. Write each line from the source code into the file. **Do not copy and paste**. The point is to learn by doing.
4. Read the detailed description and the code you just wrote.
5. Run the code, see if you get the desired output. If you dont, return to step 3. _**Note**: Some sections will have **secret bugs** just for you to figure out!_
6. If you feel confidant check out the extra credit portions, change the code around, and get messy!

It is very important that you type each bit of source code out. It will make the learning process a whole lot easier and give you a deeper, first hand, understanding of writing Ruby code. Once you've followed each step carefully you should understand another portion of how to program with Ruby. Initially this might be a very difficult way of learning how to program with Ruby, but if you stick with it you'll be hacking out apps left and right. One last thing before we start you on the really interesting things: Have. Fun.


## Task Zero - `_why`: I Need Ruby, Lots Of Ruby

### Description
This task won't really teach you anything Ruby related, but it will give you a great big library of things to pick from later on when you do know things. This task should take anywhere from 10 minutes to 30 minutes, depending on how many problems you bump into. It's divided into 3 sections, one for each major common development platform (Operating System), however we think the easiest is Ubuntu:

#### Ubuntu (Linux)

A LIST OF STEPS FOR UBUNTU USERS

#### Window (XP)

A LIST OF STEPS FOR WINDOW USERS, BUT REALLY YOU'RE PRETTY BONED

#### Mac (OS X)

A LIST OF STEPS FOR MAC USERS

## Task One -- A Boy And His Dog

> **Note**: If you haven't finished Task Zero you're going to have a very unpleasant time. This is the first and last time I'll tell you not to skip ahead.

### Summary

You should by now know what a terminal is. If you don't remember, just go back to Task Zero.. This task will show you how to print text directly to the terminal output.

### Source

    puts "A Boy And His Dog"
    puts "================="
    puts "It was a cold winter morning in the Forgotten Valley."
    puts "The boy looked to his dog and said, 'Look there, Lucky!'"
    puts "'The Temple of Golden Arches!' The dog glumly barked."
    puts "Venturing forth they climb down from the mountainside."
    puts "'We're sure to find lost treasure there!'"
    puts "The abandoned temple to the Golden Arches awaited."

### Result

    $ Ruby lyar1.rb
    > A Boy And His Dog
    > =================
    > It was a cold winter morning in the Forgotten Valley.
    > The boy looked to his dog and said, 'Look there, Lucky!'
    > 'The Temple of Golden Arches!' The dog glumly barked.
    > Venturing forth they climb down from the mountainside.
    > 'We're sure to find lost treasure there!'
    > The abandoned temple to the Golden Arches awaited.

### Details

You might not realize it but you've done three things already just by writing this source code and running it:

1. You've written your first method!
2. You've written your first string!
3. You've used the " to create a string!

After you run this script you should have a series of text lines appearing in your terminal screen, one after the other. A small story has formed before your very eyes! It's time to describe each portion of this source code:

* Each line in the source code tells the Ruby interpretor to print the string out to the display
* `puts` is a method. This method sends text to the output. The output we're dealing with in this source code is the terminal screen.
* `"` or the _double quotation mark_ is used to tell Ruby that the text it wraps around is a string.
* A string is a series of characters connected together.
* A character is a unit of information that roughly corresponds to a grapheme, grapheme-like unit, or symbol, such as in an alphabet or syllabary in the written form of a natural language.

You may also notice that there is a space between `puts` and the first `"`. This is a single _whitespace_ space character (Also shown as `\b` or `\s` inside strings). You can put as many _whitespace_ space characters as you want because Ruby will ignore those. Other _whitespace_ characters include the tab (`\t`) and the return (`\n` or `\r`), but we'll talk about those later.

### Extra Credit

1. Change some of the words (other than puts) in the story.
2. Add some extra words and characters to the story.
3. Add some extra lines to the story with extra puts methods.
4. Change the `'` characters (called _single quotation marks_) to `"` characters. What happens? Then revert to the original.
5. Change the inside `'` characters to `"` characters and the outside `"` characters to `'`. What happens? Then revert to the original.
6. Change the `puts` method to something else. What happens? Then revert to the original.
