## How This Book Works

**Good!** You've heroically made it to chapter two. I promise this chapter won't be too terribly long. In fact it'll only be 5 seconds. In fact chapters three through ten will all be five sections long, while chapter two will have 2 setup sections and 5 learning sections. Each section of each chapter will be in four important sections:

* A brief description of what the section will teach you
* A bit of source code
* A detailed description of each (new) improtant part
* And some extra credit tasks

Now that we know all the pieces to the puzzle it's time to learn how to read and use this book. Follow each step exactly and then go wild:

* **Step 1**: Read the brief description, don't worry if you don't fully undertand it
* **Step 2**: Create a new file, in your projects directy (We'll get to that), called `lyar#.rb` and replace the # with the task number.
* **Step 3**: Write each line from the source code into the file. **Do not copy and paste**. The point is to learn by doing.
* **Step 4**: Read the detailed description and the code you just wrote.
* **Step 5**: Run the code, see if you get the desired output. If you dont, return to step 3. _**Note**: Some sections will have **secret bugs** just for you to figure out!_
* **Step 6**: If you feel confidant check out the extra credit portions, change the code around, and get messy!

It is very important that you type each bit of source code out. It will make the learning process a whole lot easier and give you a deeper, first hand, understanding of writing Ruby code. Once you've followed each step carefully you should understand another portion of how to program with Ruby. Initially this might be a very difficult way of learning how to program with Ruby, but if you stick with it you'll be hacking out apps left and right. One last thing before we start you on the really interesting things: Have. Fun.


## Task Zero - `_why`: I Need Ruby, Lots Of Ruby

### Description
This task won't really teach you anything Ruby related, but it will give you a great big library of things to pick from later on when you do know things. This task should take anywhere from 10 minutes to 30 minutes, depending on how many problems you bump into. It's divided into 3 sections, one for each major common development platform (Operating Sytem), however we think the easiest is Ubuntu:

#### Ubuntu (Linux)

A LIST OF STEPS FOR UBUNTU USERS

#### Window (XP)

A LIST OF STEPS FOR WINDOW USERS, BUT REALLY YOU'RE PRETTY BONED

#### Mac (OS X)

A LIST OF STEPS FOR MAC USERS

## Task One -- A Boy And His Dog

## Task Two -- The Wealthiest Merchant And His Daughter

## Task Three -- A Cause For Great Alarms

## Task Four -- For A Hero, There Is No If

## Task Five -- Preparing For The Wasteland
