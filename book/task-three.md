## Task Three
## Basic Math, Interpolation, and Boolean Operators


### Summary
In this task we'll be learning about how Ruby handles numbers, math, and Boolean Operators. We'll also look into something called "Interpolation."

### Source
    <script src=""></script>
    puts "Preparing For The Market And The Wasteland"
    puts "=========================================="
    puts "The boy looked over his belongings before entering the market."

    puts "He had found #{4 + 9} shotgun slugs and #{3 - 2} MRE."
    puts "The lucky dog could smell the #{10 * 3 - 2 - 10} packets of salt."

    puts "The boy wondered how much ammo he could get from the merchant!"
    puts 4 + 2 * ( 100 % 2 ) / 4 + ( ( 4 + 2 ) * 4 )

    puts "Twenty eight whole bullets! The boy needs it to last ten days, at 2 per day."
    puts "The boy and his lucky dog has enough, right? #{28 / 2 >= 10}"
    puts "Does the boy have enough for twenty days? #{28 / 2 > 20}"
    puts "What about less than 15 days? #{28 / 2 < 15}"

### Details
Like every good programming language Ruby understands basic Math easily. It knows that `2 + 2` is `4` and how PEMDAS works. Math is an important part of programming, but it's not required that you be a math genius. In fact most math programming you'll be doing will probably be the basic kind. With that said it's always good to know a few shortcuts!
