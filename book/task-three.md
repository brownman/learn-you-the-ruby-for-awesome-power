## Task Three
## Numbers, Basic Math, and Arguments


### Summary
Math is an important part of Programming, but don't worry most of the math you'll be doing is very basic. If you ever have to do anything that requires a significant amount of mathematic skill then you'll probably know how it works in the first place.

Like any good programming language, Ruby understands basic math very well.
