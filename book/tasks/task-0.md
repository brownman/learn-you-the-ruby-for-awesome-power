### Summary
This is the first task of the book and the most important. It's also the most difficult to complete, but only needs to be done once! This task shows you how to set up a proper Ruby workstation for this book.

### Source


### Result
You should have working copies of both Ruby and Gedit now installed on your computer. See the Details and Extra Credit section for more information.

### Details
The steps above assume one thing: You know the very basics of using your computer. If you don't understand how a computer works on this level you need to take some classes, explore, learn. But don't go beyond this point until you do. Ruby is a tool and requires that much respect.

If you encounter any problems just copy and paste the error into [http://gist.github.com](http://gist.github.com). Take the new Gist URL and paste it into a new github issue: [http://github.com/krainboltgreene/learn-you-an-ruby-for-awesome-power/issues](http://github.com/krainboltgreene/learn-you-the-ruby-for-awesome-power/issues).

### Extra Credit
1. Open a few text files with gedit and get to know the interface.
2. Customize gedit, Terminal, and your OS to better suit your style.
3. Go to the Learn You The Ruby website and read through the glossary.
4. Type this in these terminal
    1. `rvm gemset create web-development`
    2. `gem i haml thin nokogiri pony rack rake rdiscount rspec sequel sqlite3-rubyn sinatra rails nanoc --no-ri --no-rdoc`
    3. `sudo apt-get install nginx` or `sudo apt-get install lighttpd`
    4. `rvm 1.9.2@web-development`
